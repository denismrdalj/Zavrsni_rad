        Once you’ve found a car you’re interested in, here are the steps you should take to bid confidently and, with any luck, win the auction!
        1. Register to Bid
        To contact the seller directly and place bids, you must first  with a valid credit card and phone number. Winning bidders pay Cars & Bids a 4.5% buyer’s fee on top of the winning bid amount (minimum of $225, maximum of $4,500).

        2. Perform Due Diligence
        While we’ve tried to make buying a car online as safe and easy as possible, it’s ultimately your responsibility to perform your own due diligence and make sure that the car you’re considering is right for you – prior to placing a bid.

        Review the listing thoroughly, including known flaws, the vehicle history report, the vehicle inspection report (if applicable), recent maintenance, photos, etc.
        Ask the seller – via comments, Seller Q&A, or the “Contact” feature – any questions that you may have about the vehicle.
        Arrange to inspect the vehicle in person, or work with the seller to schedule a detailed pre-purchase inspection (“PPI”) at a reputable shop in their area (at your cost).
        3. Arrange Financing and Logistics
        To ensure a smooth transaction, you should have the following organized prior to placing a bid.

        To facilitate your purchase, we’ve teamed up with LightStream to make financing easy and fast for users with good to excellent credit. You can check out rates and payments - and apply for a loan - directly from each auction! LightStream financing is not tied to a specific vehicle, and you can get your loan funded - and money deposited into your account - as soon as the same day you apply.**
        As a reminder, if you plan to finance this purchase, work with your lender to get your financing approved ahead of time - and keep in mind that some lenders may require specific vehicle information and may have year and mileage restrictions.
        Discuss transportation and storage timelines (if applicable) with the seller, and if you’ll be shipping the vehicle, get a quick and easy shipping quote directly on the auction page before bidding.
        4. Bid
